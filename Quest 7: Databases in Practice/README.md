# Quest 7: Databases in Practice Lab - My Data-Driven Cloud Journey! üìäüóÑÔ∏èüíæ

Building on my journey through **Cloud Economics**, **Networking Concepts**, and **Connecting VPCs**, this repo details the **Databases in Practice** lab within the AWS Cloud Quest series. This mission was all about diving deep into AWS's robust database offerings, understanding how to provision, manage, and interact with various database services to power applications. It's like becoming a master librarian for cloud data! üìö

---

## üéØ Lab Mission Unlocked: Core Objectives üéØ

This practice lab focused on gaining hands-on experience with AWS database services and understanding their practical applications.

The key objectives for this mission included:
* Learn about AWS database offerings.
* Provision and configure an Amazon RDS instance.
* Connect to a database instance.
* Perform basic database operations (e.g., creating tables, inserting data, querying data).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services I Conquered: My Database Toolkit! üõ†Ô∏è

For this mission, I primarily utilized the following core AWS database and related services:

* **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):** Used to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud, automating time-consuming administration tasks.
* **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Explored briefly as a service for secure and scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud.
* **MariaDB:** Chosen as the database engine for the RDS instance.
* **Security Groups:** Crucial for configuring network access and securing the database instance.
* **Amazon DynamoDB (briefly explored):** Learned about it as a non-relational, schema-less storage option.

## üöÄ My Journey Through the Lab (and What I Built!): üöÄ

Working with databases in AWS felt like building and managing a highly organized digital vault! Each step was about ensuring data integrity, accessibility, and security.

Here's a peek at how it all went down:

---

### 1. Reviewing Lab Objectives and Starting the Lab

Began by reviewing the practice lab objectives in the Concept section and then starting the lab. AWS services not used in this lab were disabled, and the capabilities of the services used were limited to what the lab required.

---

### 2. Exploring EC2 (Initial Search)

I performed a search for "ec2" in the top navigation bar, reviewing the search results under Services.

*Searching for EC2 in the AWS console, showing various related services.*

---

### 3. Reviewing AMI Catalog

Next, I navigated to the AMI Catalog to understand Amazon Machine Images. An AMI is a template containing the software configuration needed to launch an instance.

---

### 10. Setting Credentials

For the DB instance identifier, I typed `my-database`.
Under credential settings, I kept the default master username `admin` and chose **Self managed** for credentials management. I then typed `ILoveLearning123` for both the master password and its confirmation.

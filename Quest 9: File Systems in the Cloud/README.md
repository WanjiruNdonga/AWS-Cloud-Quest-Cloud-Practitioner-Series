# Quest 9: File Systems in the Cloud Lab - Shared Cloud Storage! üíæ‚òÅÔ∏è

My continued development in cloud infrastructure now includes a detailed overview of the File Systems in the Cloud lab. This repo chronicles my experience with the **File Systems in the Cloud** lab, a crucial mission in the AWS Cloud Quest series. It's like setting up a shared digital drive for my cloud servers, enabling seamless collaboration and data access! üöÄ

## üéØ Lab Mission Unlocked: Core Objectives üéØ

This practice lab provided hands-on experience with Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and its integration with EC2 instances.

The key objectives for this mission included:
* Launch and configure an Amazon EFS file system.
* Mount the file system to an Amazon EC2 instance.
* Connect a second EC2 instance to the same file system.
* Share files between the two EC2 instances.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services I Conquered: My Shared Storage Toolkit! üõ†Ô∏è

For this mission, I primarily utilized the following core AWS services:

* **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS):** A scalable, elastic, cloud-native NFS file system that provides shared storage for multiple EC2 instances.
* **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** Used to launch and manage virtual servers (instances) to connect to the EFS file system.
* **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):** (Implicitly used for managing permissions, though not explicitly detailed in the provided lab steps for this specific lab, it's foundational for AWS interactions).
* **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Security groups are linked to a VPC, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to instances.

## üîë Key Takeaways & File System Revelations: üîë

This lab significantly deepened my understanding of shared file systems in AWS, particularly concerning Amazon EFS.

* **EFS for Scalable Shared Storage:** Amazon EFS provides a highly scalable and elastic NFS file system that can be shared across multiple EC2 instances, simplifying data sharing and collaboration.
* **Seamless EC2 Integration:** Mounting EFS to EC2 instances is straightforward, enabling instances to access the same data without needing to provision and manage storage on each individual instance.
* **Security Groups for Access Control:** Security groups are critical for controlling network access to EFS mount targets, ensuring that only authorized EC2 instances can connect to the file system.
* **Cost-Effectiveness and Elasticity:** EFS is designed to be cost-effective, with pricing based on usage, and it automatically scales storage capacity up or down as needed, eliminating the need for manual provisioning.
* **NFS Protocol:** EFS utilizes the Network File System (NFSv4) protocol, making it compatible with Linux-based EC2 instances.

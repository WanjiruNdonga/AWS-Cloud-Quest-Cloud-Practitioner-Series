# Quest 9: File Systems in the Cloud Lab - Shared Cloud Storage! üíæ‚òÅÔ∏è

This lab explored the setup of shared cloud storage using AWS services. It details my experience with the **File Systems in the Cloud** lab, a crucial mission in the AWS Cloud Quest series. It's like setting up a shared digital drive for my cloud servers, enabling seamless collaboration and data access! üöÄ

---

## üéØ Lab Mission Unlocked: Core Objectives üéØ

This practice lab provided hands-on experience with Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and its integration with EC2 instances.

The key objectives for this mission included:
* Launch and configure an Amazon EFS file system.
* Mount the file system to an Amazon EC2 instance.
* Connect a second EC2 instance to the same file system.
* Share files between the two EC2 instances.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services I Conquered: My Shared Storage Toolkit! üõ†Ô∏è

For this mission, I primarily utilized the following core AWS services:

* **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS):** A scalable, elastic, cloud-native NFS file system that provides shared storage for multiple EC2 instances.
* **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** Used to launch and manage virtual servers (instances) to connect to the EFS file system.
* **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):** (Implicitly used for managing permissions, though not explicitly detailed in the provided lab steps for this specific lab, it's foundational for AWS interactions).
* **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Security groups are linked to a VPC, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to instances.

---

## üöÄ My Journey Through the Lab (and What I Built!): üöÄ

Enabling shared file access is vital for many cloud applications, and this lab provided an excellent practical foundation for implementing robust, scalable file systems.

Here's a peek at how it all went down:

---

*Returning to the EC2 console to proceed with instance connection and file sharing.*

---

### 20. Repeated all the above steps for WebServer2

* After successfully mounting the EFS file system to both EC2 instances (WebServer1 and WebServer2), I proceeded to confirm shared access. 
* I connected to WebServer2 and not only confirmed the presence of efs-1-setup.log but also appended the entry **efs-1 mounted in site B** to the same log file. 
* The ability to seamlessly view and modify content originating from both WebServer1 and WebServer2 within the same log file served as conclusive evidence that the EFS file system was successfully shared and mutually accessible.

## üîë Key Takeaways & File System Revelations: üîë

This lab significantly deepened my understanding of shared file systems in AWS, particularly concerning Amazon EFS.

* **EFS for Scalable Shared Storage:** Amazon EFS provides a highly scalable and elastic NFS file system that can be shared across multiple EC2 instances, simplifying data sharing and collaboration.
* **Seamless EC2 Integration:** Mounting EFS to EC2 instances is straightforward, enabling instances to access the same data without needing to provision and manage storage on each individual instance.
* **Security Groups for Access Control:** Security groups are critical for controlling network access to EFS mount targets, ensuring that only authorized EC2 instances can connect to the file system.
* **Cost-Effectiveness and Elasticity:** EFS is designed to be cost-effective, with pricing based on usage, and it automatically scales storage capacity up or down as needed, eliminating the need for manual provisioning.
* **NFS Protocol:** EFS utilizes the Network File System (NFSv4) protocol, making it compatible with Linux-based EC2 instances.

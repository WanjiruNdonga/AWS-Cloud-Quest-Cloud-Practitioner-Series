## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services I Conquered: My NoSQL Toolkit! üõ†Ô∏è

For this mission, I primarily utilized the following core AWS service:
* **Amazon DynamoDB:** A fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale.

## üöÄ My Journey Through the Lab (and What I Built!): üöÄ

This section outlines the key steps undertaken to achieve the lab objectives, providing a practical demonstration of DynamoDB operations:

---

### 1. Navigating to DynamoDB and Reviewing Tables

I began by accessing the AWS Management Console and navigating to the DynamoDB service. I familiarized myself with the existing tables in the environment.

### 2. Creating a New DynamoDB Table

I created a new DynamoDB table, defining its primary (partition) & sort key. This foundational step sets up the structure for storing items.
* I clicked "Create table" in the DynamoDB console.
* I specified the table name i.e. `UserVideoHistory`.
* I defined the primary key, including a partition key (i.e. `userid`) and an optional sort key (i.e., `lastDateWatched`).

*Defining a new DynamoDB table with its primary key attributes.*
   
* I selected the default table settings and proceeded to create the table.

---

### 3. Adding a New Item to the Table

With the table successfully created, I proceeded to populate it by adding a new item, representing a single record in the database.
* I navigated to the "Explore items" tab for my newly created table.

* I clicked "Create item" to open the item editor.

![Screenshot (5556)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d820e266-d295-4fcf-8614-b83d2b7bfce9)

* I input values for the item's defined attributes and proceeded to create the item.

---

### 4. Adding New Attributes to an Existing Item

To enrich an existing record, I added new attributes i.e. `videoID`, `preferredLanguage` & `supportedDeviceTypes`, with their corresponding values to the item already present in the table. This demonstrated the schema-less nature of NoSQL databases.

---

### 5. Updating the Item with a New Attribute

I practiced modifying data by updating the item with a new attribute i.e. `lastStopTime`

---

### 6. Querying Items Using the Primary Key

To retrieve specific items efficiently and confirm data presence, I performed a query using the table's primary key.
* From the "Explore items" tab:
* I entered a specific values for the table's partition key and sort key into the search field.
* I then executed the query (e.g., by pressing Enter or clicking "Run") to retrieve all items that match the specified primary key.

### 7. Deleting an Attribute from an Item

To demonstrate data manipulation flexibility, I specifically `removed` an attribute from an existing item, leaving the rest of the item intact.

## üîë Key Learnings & NoSQL Revelations: üîë

This lab provided critical insights into the fundamental operations of Amazon DynamoDB and NoSQL databases:

* **NoSQL Flexibility:** Gained hands-on understanding of DynamoDB's schema-less nature, allowing for flexible addition, modification, and deletion of attributes within items.
* **Core CRUD Operations:** Mastered the essential Create, Read (implied through viewing/updating), Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for items and attributes in a NoSQL database.
* **Key-Value Store Concept:** Solidified my understanding of how DynamoDB operates as a key-value store, with items uniquely identified by their primary keys.
* **Managed Database Benefits:** Experienced the ease of use of a fully managed service like DynamoDB, abstracting away server provisioning, patching, and backups.

## ‚ú® What's Next on My Cloud Quest: ‚ú®

Mastering foundational NoSQL operations is a crucial step in modern cloud development. This lab has provided a solid base. I'm now eager to delve into more advanced DynamoDB concepts such as:
* Querying and scanning data efficiently.
* Understanding and optimizing read/write capacity units (RCU/WCU).
* Implementing secondary indexes (Global Secondary Indexes and Local Secondary Indexes).
* Integrating DynamoDB with other AWS services like Lambda for serverless applications.
